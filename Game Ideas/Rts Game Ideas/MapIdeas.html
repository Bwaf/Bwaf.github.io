        <h1>Map Design ideas</h1>

        <p>We would use this idea and shap and duplicate it and put the end point from the bottom left of the image and put the duplicate point to that point to add a choke point for the factions to fight for the advantage</p>

        <p>This could also be a good option for a second map, we would obviosly change up the looks of the map a good amount, these are just refrences for the idea of the look of the game that we could use</p>
