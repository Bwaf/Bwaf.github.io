        <h1>Unit ideas!</h1>

        <img src="Assets/ForestMainUnit.jpeg">
        <p>This is the general concept of how we would want the main forest character to be (the character that the player plays as)</p>

        <hr>

        <img src="Assets/Humanmaincharacter.jpeg">
        <p>This is also the genaral idea of how the main unit would look like for the humans  (the main unit that the play plays as)</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Human units</h2>
    
        <img src="Assets/LumberJack.png">
        <p>This is the idea that we have for the lumber jack, for the axe thrower we are just going to add a throw animation and then a axe in the air animation</p>

        <img src="Assets/BKB.png">
        <p>this would be the BKB(brass knuckle brute) we would make him more bulky and musclular to give the affect of a tanky unit</p>

        <img src="Assets/ARDude.jpeg">
        <p>This would be the guy with an semi automatic AR we would just edit the cloths he is wearing to make it look like he is from the special OPS</p>

        <img src="Assets/BatteringRam.jpeg">
        <img src="Assets/Stronk Guy.jpeg">
        <p>We would put these too images together and only have the strong guy holding the battering ram</p>
        
        <img src="Assets/MiniGunner.jpeg">
        <p>this would be the minigunner unit just change up some things and make it into a pixel art</p>

        <img src="Assets/claymore.jpeg">
        <p>This would be the claymore spinner</p>

        <h2>Forest people units</h2>

        <img src="Assets/blackbear.jpeg">
        <p>This is the idea of the black bear unit</p>

        <img src="Assets/GiantSquirrel.jpeg">
        <p>This giant squirrel will throw large acorns at you, be carefull</p> 

        <img src="Assets/Wolverine.png">
        <p>This is the genral idea for the wolverine that we wil make</p>

        <img src="Assets/pterodactyl.jpeg">
        <p>this would be the unit that will carry up to 5 units of basic or medium, the high teir of units are too large for the pterodactyl to carry</p>
        
        <img src="Assets/MassiveSquirrel.jpeg">
        <p>We would just make a more massive version of this image for the game</p>

        <p>This is the general idea for the giant moose</p>

        <img src="Assets/BigFoot.jpeg">
